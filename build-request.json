The image must be loaded directly from this static path (not fetched from the backend) so it appears instantly on page load with no flash, placeholder, or other image showing first.

        "The uploaded Kingston Customizations logo (cream background, dark brown crown and script) is visible in the Hero section immediately on page load.",
        "No other image, placeholder, skeleton, or blank flash appears before the logo renders.",
        "The logo is served from a static asset path (e.g., /assets/generated/logo.png) and does not depend on a backend fetch to display.",
        "All other Hero component content (headline, tagline, layout, styling) remains unchanged.",
        "The logo also does not flash in the Header component — if the Header previously used the backend-fetched logo, it should also reference the same static asset so it renders instantly."
